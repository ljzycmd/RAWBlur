# RAWBlur
Towards Real-World Video Deblurring by Exploring Blur Formation Process

[[ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13184)]

> In this paper, we explore the blur formation process and propose to synthesize realistic blurs in RAW space rather than RGB space for real-world video deblurring. A novel blur synthesis pipeline RAWBlur and a corresponding UHFRaw (ultra-high-framerate RAW video) dataset are presented. Corresponding experiments and analysis demonstrate the proposed pipeline can help existing video deblurring models generalize well in the real blurry scenarios.
